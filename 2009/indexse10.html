 id="x13-1900010.1"></a>Aims</h4>
<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent" >The aim of this working conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques and
applications which concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of computer systems. While much attention in
the wider software engineering community is properly directed towards other aspects of systems development and
evolution, such as specification, design and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise
description of the behaviour of the system. The analysis and manipulation of source code thus remains a pressing
concern.

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"> <a 
 id="x13-2000010.2"></a>Topics Covered</h4>
<!--l. 1--><p class="noindent" >Topics include, but are not limited to: program transformation, abstract interpretation, program slicing, source level software metrics,
decompilation, source level testing and verification, source level optimisation and program comprehension. However, the emphasis of
the working conference is on the analysis and manipulation techniques <span 
class="cmti-10">themselves</span>.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"> <a 
 id="x13-2100010.3"></a>Definition of &#8216;Source Code&#8217;</h4>
<!--l. 1--><p class="noindent" >For the purpose of clarity &#8216;source code&#8217; is taken to mean any fully executable description of a software system. It is therefore
so-construed as to include machine code, very high level languages and executable graphical representations of systems. The term
&#8216;analysis&#8217; is taken to mean any automated or semi automated procedure which takes source code and yields insight into its meaning.
The term &#8216;manipulation&#8217; is taken to mean any automated or semi-automated procedure which takes and returns source
code.
