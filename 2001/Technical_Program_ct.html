Technical Program
</H1>
In keeping with the spirit and format of a workshop, SCAM will have a highly discursive nature, 
with four theme-based discussion tracks
and two keynote presentations, aimed at structuring and stimulating discussion. 
Authors will not formally present
their papers, but will be encouraged to bring up to three slides to present which they will be
able to do as a part of the discussion. Non-authors attending the workshop will also
be entitled to bring a slide summarizing their position which they may also use as part of the discussion.
A special issue of the 
Journal of Information and Software Technology is
planned which will contain a selection of full papers from SCAM and a summary of the results
from the discussion sessions.

<P>
The schedule allows each paper a 5 minute slot and each keynote a 30 minute slot.

<P>
There will be plenty of time for discussion.

<P>
We start at 9am. 

<P>
Registration takes place with teh ICSM registration at also at 8.30am until 9am on the day 
(Saturday 10th November).
