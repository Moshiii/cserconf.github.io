Definition of `Source Code'</A>
</H2>
For the purpose of clarity `source code' is taken to mean any fully executable
description of a software system. It is therefore so-construed as to include 
machine code, very high level languages and executable graphical representations
of systems. The term `analysis' is taken to mean any automated or semi automated
procedure which takes source code and yields insight into its meaning. The term 
`manipulation' is taken to mean any automated or semi-automated procedure which 
takes and returns source code.
