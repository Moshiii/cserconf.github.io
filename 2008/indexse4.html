</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent">This talk will describe some of the engineering approaches that were taken during the development of GrammaTech&#8217;s static-analysis
technology that have taken it from a prototype system with poor performance and scalability and with very limited applicability, to a
much-more general-purpose industrial-strength analysis infrastructure capable of operating on millions of lines of code. A
wide variety of code bases are found in industry, and many extremes of usage exist, from code size through use of
unusual, or non-standard features and dialects. Some of the problems associated with handling these code- bases are
described, and the solutions that were used to address them, including some that were ultimately unsuccessful, will be
discussed.
