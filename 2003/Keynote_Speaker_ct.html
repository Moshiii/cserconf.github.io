Managing multi-billion dollar IT budgets using source code analysis

<P>
<B>Abstract</B>
We present a quantitative approach for IT portfolio management.
This is an approach that CMM level 1 organizations can use to obtain
a corporate wide impression of the state of their total IT portfolio,
how IT costs spent today project into the budgets of tomorrow, how
to assess important risks residing in an IT portfolio, and to
explore what-if scenarios for future IT investments.  Our quantitative
approach enables assessments of proposals from business units, risk
calculations, cost comparisons, estimations of TCO of entire IT
portfolios, and more.  Our approach has been applied to several
organizations with annual multibillion dollar IT budgets each, and
has been instrumental for executives in coming to grips with the
largest production factor in their organizations:  information
technology.
