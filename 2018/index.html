              <h3>Welcome to SCAM'18!</h3>

              <p>The aim of the International Working Conference on Source
                 Code Analysis &amp; Manipulation (SCAM) is to bring together
                 researchers and practitioners working on theory,
                 techniques and applications which concern analysis and/or
                 manipulation of the source code of computer systems. While
                 much attention in the wider software engineering community
                 is properly directed towards other aspects of systems
                 development and evolution, such as specification, design
                 and requirements engineering, it is the source code that
                 contains the only precise description of the behaviour of
                 the system. The analysis and manipulation of source code
                 thus remains a pressing concern.</p>

              <p>SCAM 2018 will be held in Madrid, Spain.</p>

              <p>
                The 18th IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code
                Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2018) aims to bring together
                researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques, and
                applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source
                code of software systems. The term "source code" refers to any fully
                executable description of a software system, such as machine code,
                (very) high-level languages, and executable graphical representations
                of systems. The term "analysis" refers to any (semi-)automated
                procedure that yields insight into source code, while "manipulation"
                refers to any automated or semi-automated procedure that takes and
                returns source code. While much attention in the wider software
                engineering community is directed towards other aspects of systems
                development and evolution, such as specification, design, and
                requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only
                precise description of the behavior of a system. Hence, the analysis
                and manipulation of source code remains a pressing concern for which
                SCAM 2018 solicits high quality paper submissions.
              </p>

              <!-- <h3>Call for Engineering Track Papers</h3>

              <p>
                In addition to the research track (see
                separate <a data-toggle="pill" href="#call">CFP</a>), the
                18th IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code
                Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2018) will also feature an
                Engineering Track. This track welcomes six-page papers
                that report on the design and implementation of tools for
                source code analysis and manipulation, as well as
                libraries, infrastructure, and the real world studies
                enabled by these advances. To be clear, this is not the
                addition of a new track to SCAM, which will remain a two
                track conference, but a significant expansion to the scope
                of the tools track of previous SCAMs.
              </p>

              <p>What artefacts qualify as “engineering track” material?</p>

              <ul>
                <li>tools: software (or hardware!) programs that facilitate SCAMmy activities.</li>
                <li>libraries: reusable API-enabled frameworks for the above.</li>
                <li>
                  infrastructure: while libraries are purely software,
                  infrastructure can include projects that provide/facilitate access to
                  data and analysis.
                </li>
                <li>data: reusable datasets for other researchers to replicated and innovate with.</li>
                <li>
                  real world studies enabled by these
                  advances. Here the focus is on how the {tool,infrastructure, etc}
                  enabled the study, and not so much the study itself. Novelty of the
                  research question is less important than the engineering challenges
                  faced in the study.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>A successful SCAM engineering track paper should:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Fall under the topics mentioned for the <a data-toggle="pill" href="#call">SCAM 2018 research track</a>.</li>
                <li>
                  Discuss engineering work artefacts that has NOT been published
                  before. However, previous work involving the tool, but for which the
                  tool was not the main contribution, is acceptable.
                </li>
                <li>Motivate the use cases (and hence the existence) of the engineering work.</li>
                <li>Relate the engineering project to earlier work.</li>
                <li>Describe the understanding gained in developing this contribution.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>Optionally (and encouraged):</p>

              <ol start="6">
                <li>Any empirical results or user feedback is welcome.</li>
                <li>
                  Contain the URL of a website where the
                  tool/library/data etcetera can be downloaded, together
                  with example data and installation guidelines,
                  preferably but not necessarily open source.
                </li>
                <li>Contain the URL to a video demonstrating the usage of the contribution.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Note that the submission length has a limit of six
                pages, compared to the two to four pages of traditional
                tool demo papers. This gives authors enough space to
                discuss artefact motivation, design, and use cases in much
                more detail. For example, a use case would be well
                illustrated by a demo scenario with screenshots. The
                papers should be submitted electronically via the
                conference web site.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the
                engineering track program committee. Authors of accepted papers will
                be required to present their artefacts at the conference. All accepted
                engineering track papers will be published in the conference
                proceedings. The key criterion for acceptance is that the paper should
                (a) follow the above mentioned guidelines and (b) make an original
                contribution that can benefit practitioners in the field now and/or
                others designing and building artefacts for source code analysis and
                manipulation. The artefacts can be in an early research prototype or a
                polished product ready for deployment. Papers about commercial
                products are allowed, as long as the guidelines described above are
                followed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Videos and other demo material may be taken into account by
                reviewers as they review the paper. However, such material will not
                become part of the permanent record of the conference, so the paper
                should be self contained. In order to preserve the anonymity of the
                reviewers, such material should be hosted on an anonymous public
                source (e.g., youtube), or made available in such a way that the tools
                chair can download them once and redistribute them to reviewers.

                <h4>Madrid, Spain</h4>
                <p>
                  Madrid is the capital and largest city of Spain, as well as the capital of the autonomous community of the same name (Comunidad de Madrid).
                  The population of the city is roughly 3.3 million with a metro area population of almost 6.5 million.
                  Madrid is best known for its great cultural and artistic heritage, a good example of which is the El Prado museum (a detailed travel guide can be found <a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/en">here</a>).
                  Madrid also boasts some of the liveliest nightlife in the world.
