# Slides

During SCAM 2013, as is traditional, the presenters of accepted papers put
forward controversial statements and questions which were discussed in the
group. Each question and statement was written on transparent slides and projected using an overhead projector.

Please find a PDF with all these slides [here](./images/notes.pdf).
