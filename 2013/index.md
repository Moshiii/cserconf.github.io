The aim of this working conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques and applications which concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of computer systems. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is properly directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise description of the behaviour of the system. The analysis and manipulation of source code thus remains a pressing concern.

All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings which will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

Best papers from SCAM 2012 will be considered for revision, extension, and
publication in a special issue of the [Journal of Software: Evolution and
Process](http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-SMR.html).
