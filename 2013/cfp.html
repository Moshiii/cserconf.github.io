<p>13th IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM)</p>

<p>22nd-23rd September <br>
Eindhoven, The Netherlands <br>
Co-located with ICSM 2013 </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ieee-scam.org/2013">http://www.ieee-scam.org/2013</a></p>

<p>Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society (pending).</p>

<h2>Conference aims</h2>

<p>The aim of this working conference is to bring together researchers
and practitioners working on theory, techniques and applications that
concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software
systems. The term “source code” refers to any fully executable 
description of a software system, such as machine code, (very) high 
level languages and executable graphical representations of systems.
The term “analysis” refers to any (semi-)automated procedure that 
yields insight into source code, while “manipulation” refers to any 
automated or semi-automated procedure that takes and returns source
code.</p>

<p>While much attention in the wider software engineering
community is (rightfully!) directed towards other aspects of systems
development and evolution, such as specification, design and
requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only
precise description of the behaviour of a system. Hence, the analysis
and manipulation of source code remains a pressing concern for which
SCAM 2013 solicits high quality paper submissions.</p>

<h2>Covered topics and paper formats:</h2>

<p>We welcome the submission of high quality papers that describe 
original and significant work in the field of source code analysis 
and manipulation. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>program transformation and refactoring</li>
<li>static and dynamic analysis</li>
<li>source level software metrics</li>
<li>decompilation</li>
<li>bug location and prediction</li>
<li>security and vulnerability analysis</li>
<li>source level testing and verification</li>
<li>concern, concept and feature mining</li>
<li>program comprehension</li>
<li>bad smell detection</li>
<li>abstract interpretation</li>
<li>program slicing</li>
<li>source level optimization</li>
<li>green source code</li>
<li>and much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>SCAM explicitly solicits results from any theoretical or technological
domain that can be applied to these and similar topics. Submitted 
research papers are limited to 10 pages. Papers must be clearly marked
as a research paper. All papers submitted should follow the IEEE 
Computer Society Press Proceedings Author Guidelines. The papers 
should be submitted electronically via the conference web site: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2013">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2013</a> (select the 
”SCAM 2013 Research Track”). Each submission will be reviewed by at 
least three members of the programme committee, judging the paper on its 
novelty, quality, evaluation and scientific rigour. Note that submitted papers 
should not have been published before, and should not have been submitted 
elsewhere in parallel to SCAM 2013.</p>

<p>SCAM 2013 will also feature a tool paper track for papers that report on the 
design and implementation of tools for source code analysis and manipulation. 
Tool papers are limited to 6 pages and are reviewed by a different
programme committee. More details can be found in the tool track CFP on <a href="http://www.ieee-scam.org/2013">http://www.ieee-scam.org/2013</a>.</p>

<h2>Keynote</h2>

<p>Like in previous years, SCAM 2013 will feature an outstanding keynote. More 
details will follow later.</p>

<h2>Proceedings</h2>

<p>All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings, which will be published 
by the IEEE Computer Society Press.</p>

<h2>Special Issue</h2>

<p>The best research and tool papers will receive an award at SCAM 2013. 
Furthermore, the top papers from SCAM 2013 will be considered for revision, 
extension, and publication in a special issue. More details will follow.</p>
