# IEEE COPYRIGHT INFORMATION

IEEE policy requires that prior to publication all authors or their employers must transfer to the IEEE in writing any copyright they hold for their individual papers. Please visit the following URL to learn more about securing copyright transfer, and to register your interest in using the electronic IEEE Copyright Form for your conference: <http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/rights/copyrightmain.html>

The appropriate copyright clearance code notice is to appear on the bottom of the first page of each paper according to the guidelines set forth in the Cataloging/Copyright Instructions for an IEEE Conference Proceeding. Detailed instructions can be found at: <http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/about/documentation/copyright/cfrmlink.html>

 * For papers in which all authors are employed by the US government, the copyright notice is: `U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright`
 * For papers in which all authors are employed by a Crown government (UK, Canada, and Australia), the copyright notice is: `copyright notice is:  978-1-4673-5739-5/13/$31.00 ©2013 Crown`
 * For all other papers the copyright notice is: `978-1-4673-5739-5/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE`

Latex users can add following lines just before `\begin{document}` for the copyright notice to show up (shown below as an example for the third case above):

```
\IEEEoverridecommandlockouts
\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{978-1-4673-5739-5/13/\$31.00~\copyright~2013 IEEE \hfill} \hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{ }}
```

MSWord users can use: ‘Insert’ -> ‘Text box’, insert the appropriate copyright notice in the texbox, and place the box (without border) at the bottom left on the first page.
