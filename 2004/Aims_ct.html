Aims</A>

<P>
The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners working on theory, techniques and applications which
concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code
of computer systems. While much attention in the wider software engineering
community is properly directed towards other aspects of systems
development and evolution, such as specification, design and
requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains 
the only precise description of the behaviour of the system. 
The analysis and manipulation of source code thus remains a 
pressing concern.
