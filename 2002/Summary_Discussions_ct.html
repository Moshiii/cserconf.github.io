SCAM 2002 Discussion Points 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>What are the enabling techniques for SCAM:
       
<OL>
<LI>Parsing
</LI>
<LI>Slicing
</LI>
<LI>Data Flow Analysis
       
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Many analyses start with information obtained from a compiler.  However,
compiler is prejudiced towards compilation and thus may not be the best source
of information.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Related question: what are the lex and yacc of analysis tools?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We need to include knowledge known before the source was created/modified
(e.g. what was in the designers/maintainers head).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Complete automation is a mistake ... better to combine machine and human
effort in a symbiotic relationship.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Information is available in coding style imposed by framework (e.g. OO) and
management; in general, there is idiomatic information available in the code
(e.g. UML has a structure that might be exploited).  Thus, there are
abstractions other than the source that are useful. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Given source is executable, it's the final "word" on the meaning of the
system; even if documentation is out of date it still provides some useful
information. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Engineer's needs are specific; therefore, they need tools to focus on
particular questions not tools that produce exhaustive solutions.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A quick
vague answer may be sufficient and even better than, a more precise answer that
takes a long time to compute.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>What is the correct (useful) combination of static and dynamic information?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>How does one account for things that are unknown while performing an
analysis (e.g. the affect of a call to an unknown procedure)?  Here,
conservatism is not necessarily the right choice.  Algorithms that are correct
most of the time, but incorrect sometimes, may be useful if they save a
programmer time.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A programmer uses a library by chaining together calls to build a program. 
How do we treat software tools in the same way so that the user can pick the
tools s/he needs and chain them together.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Transformations can be specified using source code templates.  This allows
programmer to work with a "formalism" that s/he is familiar with. (i.e. it is
the "Lingua franca").

<P>
</LI>
<LI>What are the use-cases that drive the need for slicing?  Have slicing
proponents have put the cart before the horse?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Chopping is often more useful than slicing.
