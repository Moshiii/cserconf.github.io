Technical Program
</h1>


<p>

In keeping with the spirit and format of a workshop, SCAM will have a highly discursive nature, 
with  theme-based discussion tracks
and a keynote presentation, aimed at structuring and stimulating discussion. 

</p><p>
Authors will have a 15 minute slot to present their work. 
This is 10 minutes (maximum) for
talking with 5 minutes (minimum) for questions.  Authors are encouraged 
not to attempt to present the details of their paper in this time. 
Rather, respecting the
discussion-centered goal of SCAM, 
authors are encouraged to use a <b>few</b> slides to present points, claims, 
issues and topics for discussion and to use their time allocation to attempt to
set the agenda for the ensuing discussions.

</p><p>
Each session has a specifically allocated discussion time at the end of the 
presentations to allow for this.

</p><p>
A clicakble version of the technical program with links to authors and full text papers
is <a href="http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/zheng/scam2005/programme.html">available</a>.
