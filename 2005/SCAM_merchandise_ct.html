SCAM merchandise</A>
</H1>
The SCAM workshop has proudly produced imaginative and useful branded take away items as part of the
workshop attendees package. There is already some evidence that these are becoming collectible items.
In 2001 there was a SCAM Mug, which computed slices when filled. 
In 2002 in Montr&#233;al there was a bi-lingual  biro and a tee-shirt.
In 2003 in Amsterdam attendees were given an attractive AmstarSCAM glass.
In 2004 in Chicago there was a blueSCAM thermal mug with a Saxophone logo for the "S" of SCAM.
In 2005 in Budapest, attendees will be rewarded with a tasteful porcelain 
Danubius mug, in which the SCAM logo
appears discretely as the waters of the Danube. Here is a picture of the mug
