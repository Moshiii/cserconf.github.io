Workshop social event</A>
</H1>

<P>

<P>
In keeping with tradition, there will be a SCAM social event. 
This is a great opportunity to make new acquaintances and to renew
older ones.

<P>
This year the social event will be located on a party ship. 
The ship will have a 1 hour trip outside Budapest, 
then it will cruise inside Budapest for 2 hours. 
Service will include a reception, and the bar will be 
open for the participants.
What a great way to see Budapest and to meet the rest of the 
community.

<P>
The social event is included in the registration fee.
We are able to do this because of the generous sponsorship
extended to the workshop from the sponsors listed on the home page.

<P>
The tour starts on September 30th, 2005 at 19:00, boarding starts at 18:30. 
The ship departs from and arrives back at a dock named 
Bring&#243; at the Margaret Island. 

<P>
See you there.
